Classes
	A 	-> 	10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255		~> 16 Million IP address
	B	-> 	172.16.0.0 - 172.16.255.255		~> 65535 IP address
	C	->	192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255	~> 256 IP address

subnet 			-> is breaking a bigger network into smaller peice.
supernetting	-> combining smaller networks into a bigger network.

VPC:
-----
	- Virtual Private Cloud
	- it provides the networking components:
		- IP address range	- overall IP range
		- subnet			- smaller network within IP range
		- route table		- decides where to send the packet
		- Internet gateway	- IGW allows the packet to be sent on internet
	- whenever a new AWS account is created, by default you will get ONE VPC from AWS. this VPC is generally known as Default-VPC.
	- this default VPC MUST be present everytime.
	
Security group (SG)
	- its a firewall for your EC2 instance
	- it allows or deny any incoming (inbound) or outgoing (outbound) traffic
	- by default, SG DOESNOT allow any port number. you need to manualy add port numbers.
	- in Azure, same is known as NSG (Network Security Group)
	- 
steps to create a VPC:
	1. create a VPC
	2. create subnet(s), associated with the VPC
	3. create internet gateway (IGW), 
		- if you need to send and recieve traffic from internet.
		- attach IGW with VPC.
	4. then you need to create route table and associate the IGW with RT
	
S3 bucket:
--------------
	- simple storage service
	- like google drive
	- the objects (data stored in S3) can be accessed over the URL.
	- to access object over internet, you need to enable the public access.
	- to enable public access, json code is required.
	
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::mycloudfronts3bucket01010/*"
        }
    ]
}

Object URL: - https://demowipro01.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/jaguar.jpg
-------------
https://			-->	Protocol to access the object
demowipro01.		-->	bucket name
s3.					--> resource
us-east-2.			-->	Region
amazonaws.com		--> domain name
/jaguar.jpg			--> object name

Azure:
=========
	- old version of Azure is called "ASM Portal" (Azure Service Manager)
		- ASM portal
		- old portal
		- classic portal
	- its called "ARM portal)
			- Web browser (portal)
			- PowerShell (here you need to install module "AZ")
			- RestAPI

Azure requires the following:
	- subscription - its an identity 
	- resource group - its collection of resources" (Azure Resource Manager)
	- ARM portal
		- works with the help of Resource Groups (RGs)
			- RG: is a logical container that contains the resources in it.
			- Resources like:
				- VMs
				- Storage
				- Network
				- Firewall
				- NSG
				- AI/ML
		- Sends information from your device to Microsoft datacenter using file format called "JSON" (JavaScript Object Notation)
		- ARM portal supports automation using "ARM Templates".
		- ways to connect to Azure portal (ARM portal)
			- Web browser (portal)
			- PowerShell (here you need to install module "AZ")
			- RestAPI

Azure requires the following:
	- subscription - its an identity 
	- resource group - its collection of resources
	
types of subscriptions
	- Free trial (30 days, Rs13300)
	- Pay as you go (you pay, for what you use)
	- MSDN subscription (MCTs)
	- Visual Studio Benefits (developer).
	- Enterprise subscription (organizations)

Service:
	virtual machine		-> Azure virtual machine
	network				-> Azure virtual network (vNet)
	storage				-> Azure storage account
	user/groups			-> Microsoft EntraID (Azure Active Directory)
	
vnet - 192.168.0.0/16
sub  - 192.168.1.0/24
	VM1 -> IP - 192.168.1.4 / 24
	VM2 -> IP - 192.168.1.5 / 24
	
1.1, 1.2, 1.3		->  1.1 (gateway), 2&3 -> redundant IP for GW

Azure Storage Account:
---------------------
	- it is used for storing data
	- type of azure storage account:
		- BLOB storage
			- Binary Large OBject
			- used for storing large amount of data.
			- it stores data like:
				- text
				- PDF
				- MP3/MP4
				- VHDs
				- Excels
				- images (PNG, JPG, JPEG)
		- Azure File Share
			- its the Network File Sharing (NFS) solution
			- multiple people can access this storage at a time.
		- Azure Table storage
			- its the SQL solution 
			- to store data in rows & columns
		- Azure Queue storage
			- data is stored in form of queue
			- First In First Out (FIFO)
	- keys in azure storage:
		1. Access keys
			- are the master keys to access WHOLE storage account
		2. Shared Access Signature (SAS) keys
			- limited access key
			- we can control:
				- list
				- read/write
				- set the expiry
				- set which service you can use:
					- BLOB
					- Azure file
					- Table
					- Queue
