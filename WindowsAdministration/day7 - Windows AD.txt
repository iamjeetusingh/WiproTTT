Group Policy:
===============
	- aka Group Policy Object (GPO)
	- Group Policy is a policy that provides centralized mgmt and configuration of operating systems, applications, users, settings.
	- Group Policy uses GPO to define the configuration.
	- GPOs are linked to 
		- sites
		- domain 
		- organizational units
	- it affects users and computers
	
Advantages:
	- centralized management
		- admin can configure settings for whole domain
	- improve security
		- enforce password policy, restrict software installation, upgradation or removal.
	- automation
		- GPO can be set automatically
	- consistency
		- GPO ensure ALL systems are getting same policies only.
		
DisAdvantages:
	- complex
	- performance impact

how a GPO is applied, after creation:
	- cmd --> gpupdate /force
	- sign out & sign in again.
	- reboot/restart
	- wait for 90-120 minutes
	
types of group policy settings:
	1. Computer configuration
		- applies to computers, regarless of who logs in.
	2. User configuration
		- applies to user, regarless of which device they use.
		
each type (computers config or user config)
	- Software settings
	- windows settings
	- administrative templates
	
Group policy order:
	1. local group policy
	2. site GPO
	3. domain GPO
	4. OU GPO
	
GPO
	1. to set the wallpaper for the all machines
	2. disable the control panel on all machines
	
What can I do with group policies?
	- set password policy
	- account lockout
	- disable task manager
	- disable control pannel & settings
	- disable access to command prompt or powershell
	- install softwares (.exe or .msi)
	- change network settings
	- set login/logoff scripts

AD DS replication:
-------------------
	- AD replication is a process by which changes made on one domain controller (DC) are synchronized across multiple DCs with the domain or forest.
	- this ensures the consistency and high availability of 
		- users
		- group
		- computers
		- policies
		
Key-concepts:
---------------
- Multi-master replication 
	- all writable DCs can accept changes and replicate them other (except RODC)
- Replication topology
	- defines how DCs connect and replicate with each other.
- sites & site links
	- site - physical geo-graphical location (Bhopal, Bangalore, Goa)
	- site-links - connection link between 2 sites

Types of AD replication:
	1. Intra-site replication
		- occurs between DCs in the same site.
	2. Inter-site replication
		- occurs between DCs in the different sites.
		
BH - Bridge Head accepts the changes 
KCC 
	- Knowledge Consistency Checker
	- responsible for checking and synchronizing changes between the DCs within same site. (intra-site replicataion), this takes 30seconds.
	- KCCs work in a single direction.
	- Every site has a Bridge Head (BH) that connects with another site for synchronization (inter-site replicataion)
	- BH syncs with each other in every 180 minutes (3Hrs)

Pre-requisites:
	- at least 2 domain controllers are needed
	- both should be in domain/forest
	- proper DNS must be configured.
	


Task
------
	- install a new windows server 2016 datacenter eval (Desktop Exp)
	- post-installation steps
		IP = 192.168.10.13/24
	- domain join this new system
	- login as domain administrator on this server
	- install ADDS role
	-
