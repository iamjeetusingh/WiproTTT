DC		- WinDC		- 192.168.10.10/24 - iSCSI storage
Client1 - Node01	- 192.168.10.11/24 - failover cluster feature
Client2 - Node02	- 192.168.10.12/24 - failover cluster feature 

Installing failover cluster on Node01 & Node02
------------------------------------------------
Node01:




to add a new node (Node03) to the cluster:
	- install a new OS
	- perform post installation configuration
	- domain join it.

	- common usage:
		- IIS web servers
		- VPN server
		- terminal server
	- unlike failover cluster, NLB DOES NOT require shared storage
	
Steps to configure NLB:
	- on Node01:
		- install IIS web server
		- edit the web page on this server
		- verify
		
	- on Node02:
		- install IIS web server
		- edit the web page on this server
		- verify
	
Ques - Configure an NLB and create a highly-available IIS website.
