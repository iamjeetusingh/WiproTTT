Preparation steps for upgrades and migration:
---------------------------------------------
1. Assessing and Planning
	- check the hardware inventory 
	- identify incompatible hardware, drivers or applications
	- decide the type of:
		- in-place upgrade (same hardware)
		- migrate (new hardware)

2. understand the upgrade/migration path:
	- in-place
	- migration
	- cluster OS rolling upgrade
	- cross-forest/domain migration
	
3. Testing
	- set up a small/testing environment
	- validate applications, services or custom scripts.

4. backup & recovery planning
	- take full system backup
	- backup documents, setting
	- validate restore procedure before upgrading
	
5. prepare the target environment
	- install & patch the targeted windows server
	- join the system to domain, configure roles/services
	- ensure the hardware, drivers & firewares are updated
	- install the migration tools (windows server migration tool)

6. perform upgrade/migration
	- follow the check-list
	- use migration tools:
		- windows server migration tool
		- Active Directory migration tool (ADMT)
		- storage migration services
		- hyper-v live migration
		
7. post migration tasks
	- validate all services like DHCP, DNS are functioning
	- update the group policies, scripts, monitoring tools.
	- remove old server roles & decommission it.
	- update the stakeholders.
	
Windows Server activation model:
--------------------------------
	various server activation models are:
		- retail
		- volume licensing
		- cloud environment
	--------------------------------------

Retail activation (MAK - multiple activation key)
	- used for indivudial purchase
	- each key can be used limited number of times.
	- useful in small/medium businesses
	
volume licensing
	- for large organization
	- offers 2 methods:
		- MAK (multiple activation key)
			- one-time activation
		- KMS (Key Management System)
			- requires minimum of 25 clients
			- clients must re-active every 180 days.

Active Directory-Based Activation
	- integrated with AD
	- no need to configure machine maually
	- activation is valid for 180days, it auto-renews after that.

Automatic Virtual Machine Activation (AVMA)
	- used in Hyper-V environment
	- it allows VM to active automatically, if hyper-v is running on datacenter edition
	- no internet, no KMS or MAK is required
	
Understanding iSNS, DCB & MPIO:
-------------------------------
iSCSI:
	- Internet Small Computer System Interface
	- iSCSI is a networking protocol that allows data transfer over IP (TCP/IP) networks.
	- it enables SCSI commands to be sent over the ethernet channel.
	- we need 
		- a server (initiatior)
		- storage device (target)
	- cost-effective setup over fiber channel

FCIP
	- Fibre Channel over IP
	- FCIP is a networking protocol that uses fibre channel over IP networking
	- aka IP storage tunnelling
	- it is helpful in geo-graphical sharing
	- used in datacenters

1. iSNS
	- Internet Storage Name Service
	- to help discover, manage & configure iSCSI and FCIP devices in large environment
	- it provides nameing & discovery for iSCSI target and initiatior.
	it provides centralized iSCSI storage
	
2. DCB
	- Data Center Bridging
	- to make ethernet lossless and suitable for storage traffic in data centers.
	- it ensures high reliable & zero data loss over ethernet

3. MPIO
	- Multi-path Input Output
	- to provide redundancy, high availablity & performance for storage path
	- used in SAN storages
	- ensures the fault tolerence

Real-World:
##############
	iSNS - a phonebook for storage, help devices find each other.
	DCB  - like a traffic rule, gives priority to importance vehicles
	MPIO - having multiple paths to a destination
	
Data Deduplication in Windows Server 2016:
------------------------------------------
	- aka dedup
	- dedup is a built-in windows feature introduced in server 2012.
	- the feature help in optimizing storage by identifying and removing the duplicate data from the storage
	- best suited for:
		- file server (home directories, shared folders
		- backups
		- VHD/VHDX files
	- not recommended for:
		- database
		- exchange server
		- hyper-vms
	- types of dedup:
		1. file-level deduplication
			- it maintains the single copy of every version
			- consumes more space.
		2. block-level deduplication
			- it breaks down the whole data into vaiours blocks & 
			- then stores only unique data blocks
			- much more efficient 
			- consumes less space.
			
steps to configure dedup on windows server:
-------------------------------------------
	1. install the data deduplication feature
	2. verify
		> get-windowsfeature -name fs-data-deduplication
	3. configure it
	4. to check the status of dedup
	
Ques - install and perform data deduplication	OR
Ques - add spanned volume and enable data-deduplication feature on it.
	- adding disk in windows server
	- install data dedup feature
	- config dedup
	- verify
	
Storage Spaces:
----------------
	- allow you to add multiple disks together and make one logical disk from it.
	- aka LVM in linux
	- it is built-in feature of windows 10/11
	- steps to create storage spaces:
		- add minimum 2 disks (reuse, if you have attached any earlier)
		- ensure those are "UNALLOCATED DISKS".
		- go to server dashboard page, 
			-> file & storage services
			-> volumes
			-> select storage pool --> rescan storage
			-> select storage pool --> New storage Pool
				-> Name: 
				-> select server
				-> select both disks
				-> review & create
			-> create virtual disk from this

FIle sharing between systems:
------------------------------
	1. NFS Sharing
		- to share the data between similar operating system	
			- Windows to Windows
			- Linux to Linux       
	   
	2. Samba share
		- its a cross-platform sharing method
			- Windows to Linux & linux to windows
			- Windows to Windows
			- Linux to Linux 
			
Ques - create a NFS shared folder and share it with the client and verify if it is accessible.

Levels of availablity in windows server:
-----------------------------------------
- it defines the resilency of system and its services
- server and its services must be available every time.
- different levels:

	1. High Availability (HA)
		- service must be available everytime.
		- here, we minimize the downtime of server(s)
		- achieved by applying these concepts:
			- clustering 
			- redundancy
			- automatic failover
		- technologies for HA:
			- failover clustering
			- Network Load Balancing (NLB)
			- Hyper-V replica
			
	2. Fault Tolerance (FT)
		- no interruptions during the hardware failure.
		- this requires hardware-level redundancy
			- redundant RAID
			- redundant power supply
			- redundant networks
		- downtime is unacceptable.
		
	3. Disaster Recovery (DR)
		- restoring the service after major failure
		- focuses on backups & replication.
	
	4. Continous Availability
		- no downtime AT ALL.
		- like:
			- Storage spaces
			- SMB multichannel
			- Cluster-Aware updating
