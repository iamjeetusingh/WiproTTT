Active Directory:
-------------------

Domain
	- it the logical administrative boundary of an organization
	- allow you to manage:
		- users
		- computers
		- policies
		- permissions
	- allow you to have full control over the environment.
	- Ex:
		- wipro.com
		- micorosoft.com
		- umar.com
		- ganesh.ka
		- training.com
		- training.in
	- we install a role called "Active Directory Domain Service (ADDS)" to get the domain in our environment.
	- with the help of this ADDS role, we can convert a SERVER into a DOMAIN CONTROLLER.
	- DOMAIN CONTROLLER - is a server that controls the whole domain/environment.
	- domain is a collection of:
		- users
		- computers
		- groups
			- collectively these 3 are called "OBJECTS".
	- it performs 2 A's:
		1. Authentication (verifies your identity)
		2. Authorization  (Granting permissions)


- Windows server offer ROLES & FEATURES.

ROLES:
	- additional functionality
	- list of roles:
		- ADDS (Active Directory Domain Service)
		- ADFS (Active Directory Federation Service)
		- ADRMS (Active Directory Rights Management Service)
		- DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
		- DNS (Domain Name System)
		- IIS Web server 
		- Hyper-V
		- WSUS (Windows Server Update Service)
		- Remote Desktop Service (RDS)

FEATURES:
	- independent components that supports the ROLES
	- are the backbone for the roles
	- list of features:
		- DotNet Framework
		- Bitlocker
		- Failover clustering
		
Active Directory:
------------------
	- its a directory service developed by Microsoft.
	- it stores the information (of objects) like:
		- users
		- computers
		- groups
	- with AD, you can manage & control:
		- Network resources
		- policies
		- user accounts & what they access.
	- to get active directory, we need to install ADDS role on domain controller.

Steps to create a domain controller (DC) --> converting a server into DC.
	- install a windows server 2016 OS
	- perform post installation configuration
	- install the ADDS role
	- configure the domain
	- restart the server & login again.
	
Terms used in AD:
------------------
- Domain 
	- its logical administrative boundary
	- domain stores the information like:
		- user, computers & groups
	- it stores these information (objects) in a database called "NTDS.DIT".
		"NTDS.DIT = New Technology Directory Service.Directory"
	- domain is represented as a TRIANGLE

- Tree
	- heirarchy of domains
	
- Forest
	- collection of AD trees
	- it shares a common schema (blueprint) & global catalog (indexing) server 
	
- Schema
	- its the blueprint
	- defines the types of objects created in the directory
	
- Global Catalog (GC)
	- its a searchable index
	- we search for the objects with the help of GC server.
	
- OU
	- Organizational Unit
	- its like a department
	- these OUs are like containers within a domain that holds:
		- users
		- computers
		- groups
	
- site
	- physical, geo-graphical location with domain
	- a site can contain multiple OUs in it.
	
- Group policy
	- its a policy that is applied to manage the domain & its objects
	- its a centralized policy to manage the objects
		- users
		- computers
		- permissions
		- security
	- to create, modify, delete a policy we need GPMC (Group Policy Management Console)
	
Components of Active Directory (AD)
-----------------------------------
1. Physical component
	- Domain Controller (DC)
		- it contains the copy of database (NTDS.DIT)
	- Data store
		- the file on each domain controller that stores the database information.
	- Global Catalog (GC) server
		- this server hosts the read-only copy of all the objects in domain for faster search/access
	- RODC
		- Read-Only Domain Controller
		- its a special type of domain controller with Read-Only ability
		- this RODC if often used in branch offices
		
2. Logical component
	- partition
	- schema
	- domain 
	- trees (domain trees)
	- Forest
	- Sites
	- OUs

Types of domain controller (DC)
--------------------------------
	- domain controller (DC)
	- Additional domain controller (ADC)
	- Backup domain controller (BDC)
	- Read-Only Domain controller (RODC)
	- Primary Domain Controller (PDC)
	
Converting a server into DC.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
	- install a windows server 2016 OS (done)
	- perform post installation configuration (done)
	- install the ADDS role
		- GUI - server manager dashboard page (done)
		- CLI - PowerShell
	- promote you machine from server to domain controller	
		- configure the domain controller
		- ways to promote server to DC
			1. server manager dashboard page
			2. PowerShell Script
			3. application --> dcpromo.exe (depricated)
	- restart the server & 
	- login as.
		local admin			: administrator					//OR
		domain admin/user	: domain_name\<username>
		
To test if a server is domain controller or not:
--------------------------------------------------
PowerShell cmd --> (Get-WmiObject Win32_ComputerSystem).DomainRole
Output
	- 0 - standalone machine
	- 1 - Member machine
	- 2 - Standalone Server
	- 3 - Member Server
	- 4 - Backup domain controller
	- 5 - Primary domain controller

Note: whenever you install ADDS roles (for the first time), DNS installation is mandatory.

before domain joining a member to domain (on client-side):
	- IP address  	: same range only
	- subnet mask	: same subnet mask as domain controller
	- gateway		: must be pointed to domain controller IP address
	- DNS			: must be pointed to domain controller IP address
	
before domain joining a member to domain (on DC server-side):
	- it must be POWERED-On

Windows Server Backup (WSB)
-------------------------------
	- WSB is a built-in feature to perform backup and recovery
	- you can backup:
		- system state
		- volumes
		- files
		- application date
		- entire server
		- bare-matel 
	- installation os WSB:
		- server dashboard
		- PowerShell
			- install-windowsfeature -name Windows-Server-Backup
			
Steps to install WSB:
	- create a new SCSI disk of minimum 20GB
	- create a simple volume from it.
	- install the WSB feature using dashboard
	
Failover Clustering:
--------------------
	- FC is a high-availability solution provided by windows server that allows multiple nodes to work together.
	- this provides continous availability of application, service or resources.
	- we can use FC with:
		- file server failover clustering
		- SQL server AlwaysOn availability groups
		- Hyper-V VM clustering
		- DHCP
		- IIS web server
	- key components of FC:
		- Nodes		
			- physical or virtual server within a cluster
		- shared storage
			- SAN storage
			- iSCSI storage
		- clustered role
			- the application or service that run within the cluster
			- ex:
				- file server
				- SQL server
		- Heartbeat
			- health check signal between nodes
		- Quorum
			- mechanism to avaoid the split-brain scenarios
			
iSCSI storage configuration:
-----------------------------
	DC 
		- iSCSI storage --> simple volume, spanned volume, xyz...
		- install the required role
		- configure it.
		
Steps:
- on dc, add a new 20 GB HDD
		- make it online
		- make it initialize disk
		- make a new simple volume (name: SharedDisk)
	- on dashboard page, install the "iSCSI Target server" role.
	- create the virtual disk
	- create target volume
	- add both server under "Access Servers"
	- leave "Enable authentication...."
	- click on create
	
- on node01 (client1)
	- open services.msc, run Microsoft iSCSI initiator service
	- go to control panel
	- open iSCSI initiator
	- go to target tab, add "dc" --> quick connect
	- go to volumes and devices --> auto configure -> OK
	- diskmgmt.msc 
		- online
		- initialize
		- create a new simple volume
	
- on node02 (client1)
	- open services.msc, run Microsoft iSCSI initiator service
	- go to control panel
	- open iSCSI initiator
	- go to target tab, add "dc" --> quick connect
	- go to volumes and devices --> auto configure -> OK
	- diskmgmt.msc 
		- online
		- initialize
		- create a new simple volume
