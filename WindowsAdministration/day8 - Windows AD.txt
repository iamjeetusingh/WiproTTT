DNS:
-------
	- Domain Name System
	- Port Number: 53
	- it resolves name into IP address & vice-versa.
	- aka phonebook of the internet
	- key terms:
		- domain name 
			- a readable address (google.com, wipro.com)
		- IP address
			- a numeric label (1.1.1.1)
		- hostname
			- the name of the device on a network (dc.training.com)
- types of records in DNS:
	- A record (Address record)
		- maps domain into IPv4 address
	- AAAA record 
		- maps domain into IPv6 address
	- CNAME record (Canonical Name)
		- alias (alternate name)
	- MX record (Mail Exchange)
		- mail servers
	- NS record (Name Server)
		- specifies which server is an authoritive server
	- PTR record (Pointer record)
		- maps IP address to a domain name
	- TXT record (text record)
		- used for validation
	- SOA record (Start of Authority)
		- contains administrative information 
		
Administrative Template:
---------------------------
	- Administrative Template is a feature of group policy.
	- these are the files that contains settings and policies for registry settings of the windows operating system
	- these file are stored as 
		- .ADM
		- .ADMX
	- these admin templates define registry-based policies for managing users and computer settings
		- desktop configuration
		- security settings
		- control panel
		- windows update

Why to use administrative templates?
	- control settings without scripts
	- enforce security and user restrictions
	- standardize configuration across the domain
	- provide more granular control over windows OS.

Types of Administrative Templates:
	- Built-in templates
		- already available with windows server
			- control panel
			- start menu
	- Custom templates
		- you can download or create as ".admx files" 
			- office
			- chrome
		
Default location of admin templates:
	- domain controller
		\\training.com\SYSVOL\training.com\Policies\PolicyDefinitions
		
	- local system
		c:\Windows\PolicyDefinitions
		
Folder Redirection:
---------------------
	- Folder redirection allows you to redirect the path of a known user folder
	- from local system to a network location (a file server)

- Benefits of using Folder Redirection:
	- centralized storage for user data.
	- seamless access to files from any domain-joined computer
	- saves local disk space
	- works with roaming profiles and offline files
	
common folders that can be redirected:
	- desktop
	- documents
	- Pictures
	- download 
	- favorites
	- application data
	
requirements:
	1. DC (Folder redirection)
	2. Node01 (access this)
	
Securing domain controllers
----------------------------
1. physical and logical security
	- restrictions on allowing laptop or desktop in datacenter.
	- use Bitlocker to encrypt the disks
	
2. Network security
	- isolate domain controllers using firewall
	- allow necessary ports only
	- block FTP (21) & RDP (3389) protocols

3. access control and delegation
	- least privilege policy
	- create seperate admin accounts

4. Group Policy Hardening
	- apply security baseline GPOs
	- enforce:
		- password policy
		- account lockout policy
		- user rights
		
5. Monitoring and logging
	- tools
		- Microsoft Defender for Identity
		
6. Patch mgmt
	- apply updates to windows regularly
	- use WSUS os SCCM

7. secure authentication practices
	- enable smart card access
	- implement privileged access workstation (PAWs) for admin usage.
	
Implementing Account Security:
---------------------------------
1. Enforce password policy
2. configure acoount lockout policy
3. restrict logon rights
4. use secure authentication methods
	- enable MFA
		- Google authenticator
		- Microsoft authenticator
		- DuoMObile
		- Okta
		- Yubikey
5. protect admin accounts
	- rename the built-in administrator
	- seperate admin & user accounts
6. disable stale/inactive accounts
	- set the expiry of account
7. use fine-grained password policy (FGPP)
	- do not use username in password
	
implement audit authentication:
--------------------------------
	- audit authentication helps in tracking 
		- who logged in, 
		- from where
		- & when.
		- whether the login is successful or not.
	- this is critical for security monitoring, complaiance and threat detection
	
authentication auditing:
-------------------------
	- logon attempts
	- use of logon types
		- local
		- remote
		- network
	- credential validation events
	- kerberos and NTLM authentication operations
	
why audit authentication is required?
	- detect brute-force attack
	- monitoring sensitive systems
	- checking unauthorized access
	- supports complaiance (HIPPA, PCI-DSS etc..)
	
Event IDs:
	4624	-	successful login
	4625	-	failed logon
	4634	- 	logoff
	4768	-	user-initiated logoff
	4771	-	kerberos pre-auth failed
	

Configuring Managed Service Account(MSA)
-----------------------------------------
	- MSA provides 
		- automatic password mgmt
		- simplified service principal name (SPN)
	for running services on windows
	- they are ideal for improving security and operational efficiency
	- 2 types:
		1. sMSA - Standalone Managed Service Account
		2. gMSA - Group Managed Service Account
	
	- benefits of MSAs
		- automatic password rotation (every 30days)
		- no manual password mgmt
	
	- pre-reqisites:
		- at least windows server 2012 or later
		- Powershell 5.0 or above
		- key distribution service (KDS) --> gMSA
		


Active Directory Certificate Service (ADCS):
--------------------------------------------
	- its a role that helps in	
		- creating a certificate
		- managing certificates
		- distributing certificates
		- revoking certificates
	- benefits
		- centralized certificate mgmt
		- supports SSL/TLS, IPSec, EFS, VPN, 802.1X
		- enhanced authentication and data security
		- integrated with AD for automated enrollment
		
1. shared-key method
	- single key is responsible for encrypting and decrypting the data.
	- faster in nature
	- unsafe
	
2. PKI infrastructure
	- 2 keys to encrypt and decrypt the data.
		- Public key  - will be shared with others
		- Private key - can not be shared with anyone


encryption => "hi" + algo = 1h1i2e@$aq (cipher text)

Self-Sign Certificate
	- makecert.exe (depricated)
	- OpenSSL (in linux)
	- IIS web server
	- New-SelfSignedCertificate	(powershell)
