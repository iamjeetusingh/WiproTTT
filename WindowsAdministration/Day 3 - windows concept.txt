Disks:
==========
	- Static/Standard disk
	- what is MBR?
	- what is GPT?
	- dynamic disk - allows you to extend your current HDD.
		- stripped volume
			- minimum of 2 HDDs are required.
			- both disks must be identical
			- data will be saved into 2 seperate disks 
		- mirror volume
			- minimum of 2 HDDs are required.
			- both disks must be identical
			- whole data will be stored in 1st disk & replica of this data will get stored in another disk.
			- if one disk crashes, data can be found in another disk.
			- only 50% of storage is actually in use.
		- spanned volume
			- you can use multiple disks of either identical or non-identical sizes.
			- multiple disks are used together to form a single disk.
				- windows OS --> Storage Spaces
				- Linux OS   --> LVM (Logical Volume Manager)
	- What is RAID 
		- Redundant Array of Independent Disks
	- RAID types
		- RAID 0				- Stripping
		- RAID 1				- Mirroring
		- RAID 10				- Mirroring with Stripping
		- RAID 5 (optional)		- single parity
		- RAID 6 (optional)		- dual parity

to configure RAID0:
------------------
	- attach 2 (same size disks) to your system.
	- initialize the disk using disk management utility (diskmgmt.msc)
	- convert the disks into dynamic disks
	- create RAID0 (Stripe volume)
	- go to "this PC" & verify.
	
Windows Operating Systems:
----------------------------
	1. Server Operating Systems
		- is responsible for serving the requests asked by the clients
		- example of server OS:
			- Windows NT
			- Windows Server 2008
			- Windows Server 2008R2		R = release
			- Windows Server 2012
			- Windows Server 2012R2
			- Windows Server 2016		//most org ar using this or above versions.
			- Windows Server 2019
			- Windows Server 2022
			- Windows Server 2025
	2. Client Operating Systems
		- asks/requests for some service.
		- example of client OS:
			- Windows XP
			- Windows 7
			- Windows Vista
			- Windows 8.0
			- Windows 8.1
			- Windows 10
			- Windows 11
			
Domain and Workgroups:
-----------------------
	Workgroups 
		- a system (s) will be part of the network, but they don't need a centralized server for the management.
		- no single computer has control over other machines.
		- authentication is local
		- no active directory concept
		- small & simple configuration can be done easily.
		- we can add a server or client in workgroups.
		
	Domain
		- is a type of network setup where you can manage
			- computers
			- users
			- other resource 
		  in a centralized manner.
		- for this, any organization would use "Active Directory".
		- to have the Active Directory, they have to install a role ADDS (Active Directory Domain Service).
		- domain controller
			- a server, that controls the entire domain.
		- domain member
			- a server or a client
			- its the part of domain env.

Windows Server Installation:
	1. GUI - Desktop Experience
	2. CLI - Server Core
	
	
NOTE: SELECT windows Server 2016 Datacenter eval (Desktop Experience)

Windows Server 
	- User 		-> Administrator
	- password 	-> pass@word1
	
after installation is completed, install VMWARE TOOLS.
& after installation, restart your computer.

After Server Manager Dashboard is opened (after installation), we need to perform the POST INSTALLATION CONFIGURATION.

---------------------------------------------------
steps to perform POST INSTALLATION CONFIGURATION:
---------------------------------------------------
	- change the IP address				--> ncpa.cpl
	- change the firewall settings		--> firewall.cpl
	- change the date & time zone
	- turn off IE enhanced configuration
	- Enable remote desktop
	- change the computer name
	- restart your server machine
---------------------------------------------------

Task
#####
	- install another windows server as server core (CLI) OS using the following:
		- Name of VM: WinCore
		- RAM: 1GB
		- HDD: 20GB
		- NIC: <lan segment> --> WindowsLab
		- ISO: windows server ....2016....iso
		- Installation: Windows Server 2016 datacenter evaluation

To perform post installation configuration on "server core"
	> sconfig.cmd
	
Task:
-------
	1. install windows server 2016 in GUI
	2. install windows server 2016 in CLI
	3. perform post installation configuration on both GUI & CLI
	4. ping both machines together using IP address
	5. add two 5GB disks on DC (GUI) machine
	6. create spanned disk from both 5GB disks on DC.
