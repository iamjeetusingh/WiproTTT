Active Directory Certificate Service (ADCS):
--------------------------------------------
	- its a role that helps in	
		- creating a certificate
		- managing certificates
		- distributing certificates
		- revoking certificates
	- benefits
		- centralized certificate mgmt
		- supports SSL/TLS, IPSec, EFS, VPN, 802.1X
		- enhanced authentication and data security
		- integrated with AD for automated enrollment
		
1. shared-key method
	- single key is responsible for encrypting and decrypting the data.
	- faster in nature
	- unsafe
	
2. PKI infrastructure
	- 2 keys to encrypt and decrypt the data.
		- Public key  - will be shared with others
		- Private key - can not be shared with anyone


encryption => "hi" + algo = 1h1i2e@$aq (cipher text)

to create Self-Sign Certificate:
	- makecert.exe (depricated)
	- OpenSSL (in linux)
	- IIS web server
	- New-SelfSignedCertificate	(powershell)
	
Core features of ADCS:
	- enables certificate authority (CA) to issue and manage digital certificate.
	- supports automated certificate enrollment and renewal.
	- integrated with AD 
	- enables certificate-based authentication
	- allows revocation of certificate
	
core components of ADCS:
------------------------
1. Certificate Authority (CAs)
	- is the server role that issues and revokes certificates
	- types:
		- Enterprise CA
		- Standalone CA
		
2. CA web enrollment
	- it provides a web interface for users to request certificate
	
3. Online responder
	- implements OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) for real-time certificate status checking.
	
4. Certificate Enrollment Web Service
	- allows certificate enrollment across firewalls and to non-domain joined machines using HTTPS.
	
5. Network Device Enrollment Service (NDES)
	- for routers, switches, mobile devices

6. Certificate Templates
	- defines the format, purpose and policies for certificate
	
deployment models of ADCS:
---------------------------
	1. Single-tier PKI
		- one CA (Root CA)
		- easy to deploy
		- not recommended for production
	
	2. Two-tier PKI 
		- Root CA 
			- its kept Offline
			- highly secure, rarely used
		- Sub-ordinate CA
			- it is kept online
			- it issues & manages certificate
			
	3. Three-tier PKI
		- offline root CA --> policy CAs --> Issuing CAs
		- used in very large production environments
		
use case:
	- issuing the SSL/TLS certificate for websites
	- smartcard logon
	- MFA (multi-factor authentication)
	- WiFi or VPN authentication
	- email encryption 
	- code signing for developers
	- EFS (encrypting file system) support

pre-requisites:
	- a domain joined windows server
	- you must login as domain administrator (training\administrator)
	- ensure ADDS role is already installed
	
- types of CAs:
		- Enterprise CA
			- used within a domain controller environment
			
		- Standalone CA
			- used within workgroup environment
			
Active Directory Federation Service (ADFS):
--------------------------------------------
	- ADFS is a SSO solution
		SSO - Single Sign-On
	- federation identity solution
	- it can be on:
		- organization (on-prem)
		- on-cloud
	- allows users to access applications without re-authenticating 
	- is built on standards like:
		- SAML
		- OAuth
		- OpenID Connect
		- WS-Federation

ADFS components:
	- Federation server
	- Federation server proxy
	- claims - provides information about users
	- claims rules - defines how claims are sent and consumed by FS server
	- claims providers 
	- attribute store
	- relying parties - application that trusts FS
	- relying parties trust - are configured on claims on FS
	- certificates
	- endpoints
	
ADFS pre-requisites:
	- TCP/IP network connectivity
	- AD DS
	- Attribute store 
	- DNS
	- Any windows server OS
	- certificate
	

Active Directory Rights Management System (AD-RMS)
------------------------------------------------------
	- ADRMS helps in protecting sensitive information by enforcing right-based policy
	- it helps organizations to encrypt and control usage of the data
	- ADRMS controls:
		- who can access the data
		- who can modify the data
		- forward
		- print 
	
	- core components:
		- ADDS
			- used for authentication & publishing the RMS service location.
		- ADRMS server
			- this will issue the certificates and handle policy
		- RMS Client
			- used to request and enforce rights
		- SQL Server
			- stores config, logs, licenses
		- IIS web server
			- hosting the RMB we-based licenses
		- Cluster key (server licensor certificate)
			- a root of trust for issuing the licenses
	
	- ADRMS workflow
		1. User create a document
			- word, xl, ppt.
		2. Applies rights
			- no print, no forward
		3. AD RMS encrypts the document
			- encryption + license will be attached
		4. other users request a use license
			- used for opening the document
		5. AD RMS checks policy
			- issues the license with rights
		6. Client enforces the rights
			- preventing document print.forwarding
