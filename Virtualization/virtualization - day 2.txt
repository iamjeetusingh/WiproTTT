Basics of VMware vCenter Server/ vSphere:
-------------------------------------------
	- VMware vCenter is a production level solution
	- VMware vCenter is a centralised management platform for vSphere environment.
	- it allows you to run multiple ESXi hosts and multiple virtual machines through a single interface.
	- it provides centralised control, automation and monitoring.
	- vCenter server also provides the SSO functionality
	- vCenter server requires a domain control environment & shared storage (iSCSI).

vSphere overview:
	- VMware's virtualization platform to run and manage multiple vms 
	- it consists of 2 components:
		1. ESXI server
			- its the hypervisor that runs on a physical machine
			- full form: Elastic Sky X Integrated
			- its the type 1 hypervisor
			- it provides CPU, memory and network to the VMs
			- to provide the storage to the VM, you can use shared storage (iSCSI)
			- to configure ESXi host, you need to connect using DCUI (Direct Connect User Interface) for local connectivity
			- to central management, we can use vSphere client or vCenter server.
		2. vCenter Server
			- centralised management platform for ESXI and hosts
			- vCenter can manage:
				- ESXi host
				- VMs
				- Networks
				- Datastores (storage)
				- clusters
			-  vCenter server provides:
				- HA (High Availability)
				- DRS (Distributed Resource Schedular)
				- vMotion
				- Storage vMotion 
				- Templates
				- Cloning
				- Permission & policies
				
Inventory objects in vCenter:
-----------------------------
	- Datacenter
		- is a logical container for all inventory items like cluster, hosts, VMs.
	- Cluster
		- its a group of ESXi hosts, pooled together for resource sharing and HA.
	- hosts
		- these are physical servers running the ESXi server
	- Resource Pool
		- logical abstraction to allocate memory, cpu and other resources
	- Datastores
		- storage unit for 
			- VM HDDs
			- ISO images
			- Templates (blueprint)
	- Network
		- virtual network
			- virtual switches
			- Port groups
			
VMWare vCenter types:
---------------------
	1. vCenter server
		- its now depricated
		- it was windows-server based vCenter
	
	2. VCSA (vCenter Server Appliance)
		- this is what we are using now.
		- its a linux-based vCenter server
		- VCSA uses its own operating system called "Photon"
			
Networking components:
-----------------------
	1. Virtual Switches
		- just like a physical switch, created on ESXi host during installation of ESXi server.
		- it allows VMs to communicates with eah other and external networks.
		- there are 2 types:
			- vStandard Switch (vSS)
				- local to one host
			- vDistributed Switch (vDS)
				- managed centrally via vCenter server across multiple ESXi hosts
		
	2. Port Groups
		- defines network configuration for VMs (VLAN)
			
	3. VMKernel (vmk) Port Groups
		- special port group used for host-level traffic
			- vMotion (migration)
			- management
			- Fault tolerence
			- storage 
			- vSAN - SAN storage solution within VMWare environment
			
NIC Teaming 
	- combine multiple NIC cards together to work as a single unit.
	- used for load balancing and for failover clustering
	
vMotion:
	- vMotion migrates a running VM from one host to another, without downtime.
	- it requires 
		- shared storage & 
		- a VMKernel port group with vMotion enabled.
		
Storage vMotion:
	- moves a running VM's virtual disk(s) from one datastore to another datastore with zero downtime.
	- useful in:
		- storage upgrades
		- Maintenance
		- load balancing
		
High Availability (HA)
	- Ensures the VM uptime by automatically restarting VMs on another host if one fails.
	- it requires:
		- cluster
		- shared storage
		- vCenter server (VCSA)

DRS
	- Distributed Resource Schedular
	- it automatically balances VM workloads across hosts in a cluster based on usage.
	- it can be set to:
		1. Manually
		2. Partially Automated
		3. Fully Automated

Resource Pools:
	- logical abstraction to allocate memory, cpu and other resources
	- it helps in mgmt and enforcing resource limit, reservations and shares.
	
Templates:
	- blueprint
	- this golden image can be used for faster deployment of VMs 
	- all the deployed VM with same golden image, will be identitical
	
Cloning:
	- creating an exact copy of a virtual machine
	- useful in test/dev environment
